# String Anti-Virus evasion in x64 Assembly

This repository contains the code found in my [blog post](https://www.accidentalrebel.com/string-av-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-1.html) where I revisited a simple string evasion techniue and wrote it in x64 assembly.

## How to run
* Install NASM
* Make sure you have have the Visual Studio C++ development environment setup
* Run build_and_run.bat

## Credits
I got the idea for this AV evasion technique from [this blog post](https://blog.scrt.ch/2020/06/19/engineering-antivirus-evasion/). The author talks about a lot of really cool ideas in AV evasion, so do check it out.
